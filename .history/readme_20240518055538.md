# Paltech Assignment

## Part 1: Basic waypoint manager in ROS2

### Task 1: Set waypoints from geojson file.
Complete the **set_waypoints_callback** function in **waypoint_manager.py** in order to load the waypoints to the node.

### Task 2: Coordinate transformation from geographic to robot frame.
Complete the **convert_waypoints_to_robot_frame** function in **waypoint_manager.py**. This function should convert the list of waypoints from geographic coordinates to the robot's coordinate frame (X, Y), where:  
    X represents the distance in meters to the east of the robot's initial pose.  
    Y represents the distance in meters to the north of the robot's initial pose.  
### Task3: Loaded waypoints visualization 
Plot the waypoints (X,Y,yaw) in robot coordinate frame using matplotlib or another visualization tool.  

## Part 2: Path Planning 

This task consists of designing a path planning algorithm for the robot to efficiently follow waypoints:  

- Generate M random GPS points (e.g. 500) distributed in an area of 1000 mÂ². These points represent weed positions.
- Add a cluster of approximately 2-10 plants around 50% of the M points to simulate weed clusters. This can be achieved using a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 3 meters.
- Randomly assign a starting position to the robot and perform path planning for it with the following constraints:
    - The robot is non-holonomic and follows a Dubins motion model with a minimum turning radius of 2 meters.
    - It is not necessary for the robot to reach every generated point. Points that are unreachable due to the robot's turning radius constraints can be omitted from the plan.
- Plot the calculated path. You may simplify the path using straight lines.
- Output the time and path length of the calculated path (you can assume a constant velocity of 1m/s)

**BONUS:**  

- How does the path planning change if we allow the robot to move in reverse? (REEDS_SHEPP motion model instead of DUBINS) Explain.
- What would happen if the working area of the robot is taken into account? E.G. the robot can remove weeds that are in a radius of 0,5m around its center. Explain.
