## Part 1: Basic waypoint manager in ROS2

### Task 1: Set waypoints from geojson file.
Complete the **set_waypoints_callback** function in **waypoint_manager.py** in order to load the waypoints to the node.
 - I use set_waypoints_callback function as a service callback in the to handles requests to load and set waypoints for a robot from a GeoJSON file.The function uses a service request message that includes a file path to a GeoJSON file. It processes this file, extracting waypoint data and converting it into a format suitable for the robot's navigation system.The waypoints are stored as Waypoint messages, which include latitude , longitude information an orentiation. These messages are appended to the waypoint_list_geo attribute of the class instance

### Task 2: 

- In this part i implement function to  transforms geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of waypoints into a robot's local Cartesian coordinate frame (X, Y coordinates).
The transformation is done using the Equirectangular approximation, which is a simple method to convert geographic coordinates into Cartesian coordinates. This method is suitable for small distances on the Earth's surface.The transformed waypoints are then stored in `waypoint_list_robot_frame` for further use.

### Task 3 : 
- Visualization waypoints in robot frame

## Part 2: Path Planning 
### Method 1 - The nearest neighbor method 
To implement the nearest neighbor algorithm, i begin at robot position. From there, i find the closest unvisited waypoiny  and add it to the sequencing. Then, we move to the next node and repeat the process of finding the nearest unvisited node until all nodes are included in the tour.To find the neareast unvisited node i use The `KDTree` class from `scipy.spatial` to find the k nearest neighbors of the current waypoint instead of searching the whole waypoint.

### Summary of the Nearest Neighbor 

  1. **Start at a robot position**.
  2. **Find k neareast neighbors waypoints  to the current waypoint**.
  3. **Remove neareast waypoint with robot non holonomic constrain**: waypoints such as waypoints inside the radius of the current waypoint)** 
  4. **Calculate Dubins path to each selected waypoint.** 
  5. **Select waypoint with minimum dubins  path lenght.**
  6. **Add to Path and Repeat: Add the nearest point to the path, mark it as visited, and move to this point. Repeat the process until all points are visited.**
